## Core Features:

- Authentication: User authentication and authorization via Firebase Auth (email/password).
- Club Management: Admin user interface to manage football (soccer) club information (name, logo, address, contact).
- Category Management: User interface to manage categories (U10, U12, etc.) and teams.
- Player Photo Management: User interface to add a player using a photograph, where the photo is cropped and resized by the browser before storing in Firebase.
- Reporting: User interface to generate, save, and display reports in PDF format (player cards, training attendance, match results, monthly reports).
- AI Position Suggestions: Tool for recommending player positions, based on age and physical characteristics. Uses generative AI to suggest training regimes optimized for the positions suggested.

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Vibrant blue (#29ABE2) to represent the energy and dynamism of the sport.
- Background color: Light blue (#E5F5FF), a desaturated shade of the primary, to maintain a bright feel, and keep the design clean and uncluttered.
- Accent color: Analogous color in the blue/green hue (#29E29A), with higher saturation to ensure elements such as buttons, selections, and important text stand out against the background.
- Font: 'Inter', a grotesque-style sans-serif, for its modern, neutral, and objective appearance, suitable for both headlines and body text.
- Use a clear, responsive layout optimized for various screen sizes. The dashboard should present KPIs in a visually appealing and easily understandable manner.
- Use consistent and recognizable icons throughout the app, related to football management (players, training, matches, etc.).
